requirements
design
implimentation
verificaton 
maintenance
this is a step wise and very highly systmetic procedure for the small projects bt not suitable for the large project and the 
object oriented projects waterfall model is very slow in case no function product would be their before the last step.

Q.Continuous Integration and Continuous Development
