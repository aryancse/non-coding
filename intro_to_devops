 Q.What is Devops?
DevOps is a set of software development practices that combine software development and information-technology operations to 
shorten the systems-development life cycle while delivering features, fixes, and updates frequently in close alignment with 
business objective. Here 'Dev' means developer (software development industry) and Ops means operations(IT industry)


Q.History of devops?
The idea began in 2008 with a discussion between Patrick Debois and Andrew Clay Shafer concerning the concept of agile 
infrastructure. However, the idea only started to spread in 2009 with the advent of the first DevOpsDays event held in Belgium.


Q.DevOps and Software Development Life Cycle?
sdlc is the approach which makes the operation and developer very slow interaction if we take an example of waterfall model
requirements
design
implimentation
verificaton 
maintenance
this is a step wise and very highly systmetic procedure for the small projects bt not suitable for the large project and the 
object oriented projects waterfall model is very slow in case no function product would be their before the last step.


Q.Infrastructure as code (IaC)?
Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable 
definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. The definitions may be in 
a version control system.


Q.Continuous Integration and Continuous Development?
Continuous Integration is the practice of testing each change done to your codebase automatically and as early as possible. 
Continuous Deployment follows the testing that happens during continuous integration and pushes changes to a staging or 
production system.
